Video processing application
----------------------------

This folder contains the source code for a simple video processing application
that could be adapted as tutorial for EMB².

Requirements:
- Microsoft Visual Studio: at the current stage Linux is not supported,
  as the included version of ffmpeg is built for Windows. However, ffmpeg is
  available also for Linux so it is possible to extend the framework also for this
  system.

The source code is located in the video_app folder.
In order to build the project, EMB² must be built first.
The provided source code for EMB² corresponds to the commit
784baa28765c147452e17167c198e04dbb78dcda.

HOW TO BUILD EMB²
From root, execute the following commands:

mkdir embb
cd embb_src
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G <generator> -DINSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/embb/folder
cmake --build . --config Release
cmake --build . --config Release --target install

/path/to/embb/folder refers to the path to the folder created in the first step.
The following generators should work: "Visual Studio 12", "Visual Studio 14".

HOW TO BUILD THE PROJECT
From root:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G <generator>
cmake --build . --config Release

If the building completed without errors, the application can be run.
Before doing that it is necessary to copy the dlls contained in root/dlls into
the build/Release folder, because the application is not statically linked to
them.

HOW TO EXECUTE THE APPLICATION
From root:

cd build/Release
video_app ../../test_video/gopro.mpg ../../output.mpg 1

The first argument is the input video file, the second is the name of the output
file. The third argument determines if we want to use the version of EMB² or not:
when it is 0, parallel processing is disabled.

A description of the application can be found in doc/description.pdf.
