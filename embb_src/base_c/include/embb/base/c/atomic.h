 * Atomic operations.
 *
 * \anchor general_desc_atomic_base
 * Atomic operations are not directly applied to fundamental types. Instead,
 * there is for each character and integer type an associated atomic type that
 * has the same bit width (if the target CPU supports atomic operations on
 * that type):
 *
 * Fundamental type   | Atomic type
 * :------------------| :----------------------------------
 * char               | embb_atomic_char
 * short              | embb_atomic_short
 * unsigned short     | embb_atomic_unsigned_short
 * int                | embb_atomic_int
 * unsigned int       | embb_atomic_unsigned_int
 * long               | embb_atomic_long
 * unsigned long      | embb_atomic_unsigned_long
 * long long          | embb_atomic_long_long
 * unsigned long long | embb_atomic_unsigned_long_long
 * intptr_t           | embb_atomic_intptr_t
 * uintptr_t          | embb_atomic_uintptr_t
 * size_t             | embb_atomic_size_t
 * ptrdiff_t          | embb_atomic_ptrdiff_t
 * uintmax_t          | embb_atomic_uintmax_t
 *
 * Each of the atomic operations described in the following can be applied to
 * the types listed above. However, to avoid unnecessary redundancy, we document
 * them only once in a generic way. The keyword TYPE serves as a placeholder
 * which has to be replaced by the concrete type (e.g., int). If the fundamental
 * type contains spaces (e.g., unsigned int), "_" is used for concatenation
 * (e.g. unsigned_int).
 *
 * Usage example:
 * --------------
 *
 * Store the value \c 5 in an atomic \c "unsigned int" variable.
 *
 * Step 1 (declare atomic variable):
 * \code
 * embb_atomic_unsigned_int my_var;
 * \endcode

 * Step 2 (store the value):
 * \code
 * embb_atomic_store_unsigned_int( &my_var, 5 );
 * \endcode
 *
 * The current implementation guarantees sequential consistency (full fences)
 * for all atomic operations. Relaxed memory models may be added in the future.
